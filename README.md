# KinectInMinecraft (WIP)
## Dependencies: 
- Python 2 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-272/)
- Minecraft Java Edition (https://minecraft.net/)
- Forge 1.12.2 (https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.8.9.html)
- raspberryjammod (https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod)

(I may be missing something, it's been nearly a year since I wrote the program.) 

## Future plans:
