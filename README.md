# KinectInMinecraft (WIP)
## Dependencies: 
- Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Minecraft Java Edition (https://minecraft.net/)
- Forge 1.12.2 (https://files.minecraftforge.net/net/minecraftforge/forge/index_1.12.2.html)
- raspberryjammod (https://github.com/arpruss/raspberryjammod)
- libfreenect (https://github.com/OpenKinect/libfreenect)

(I may be missing something, it's been nearly a year since I wrote the program.) 

## Future plans:
- Clean up/add comments
- Replace hardcoded numbers with variables
- Add arguments/commands to change scale
- Test with Kinect v2
